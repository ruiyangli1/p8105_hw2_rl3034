This is my solution to HW2.

```{r setup}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

```{r}
mr_trash_wheel = 
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
             range = cell_cols("A:N"),
             skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, 0))
  ) 
```
